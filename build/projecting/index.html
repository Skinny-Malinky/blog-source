      <p>
        In order to capture anything worth watching at a performance, you need a
        menagerie of microphones, cameras and a professional crew yet we still
        find ourselves trying to capture these events. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        They look awful and the sound quality follows suit. Sometimes we'll
        share these videos but it isn't about sharing a pleasant experience, so
        why do we share it?
      </p>

      <h3>Making yourself known</h3>
      <p>
        People have held up lighters and phones up at events for a lot longer
        than camera phones have existed. A big part of the experience is making
        ourselves known. It's a collective recognition of joy but was not
        traditionally used to go any further than the relationship between the
        people in the room. It's almost like we're attempting to bring others
        into this rich collective experience.

      <p>
        We also make ourselves known on digital platforms despite having nothing
        to say in particular. This can take the form of thoughtless text or
        custom emojis in the case of Twitch on the left below or spamming hearts
        on Periscope on the right.

      <h3>Recording as performance</h3>
      <p>
        There is a performative aspect to recording. It adds to our self image
        and reinforces ideas that we have about ourselves. We project an ideal
        self through sharing these experiences. We are extrinsically motivated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dancing holds tension between being individually performative and
        collectively joyous. Being in an audience thrives on that experience. It
        helps us experience joy collectively, around the same art, while
        physically being in the same place and performing through dance.

      <h3>Narcissism</h3>
      <p>
        So what's at the root of the desire to share our live experiences? A
        desire to be understood? Do we show our exterior in the hopes that
        others will intuitively understand our interior? Or do we just want to
        be <strong><i>cool</i></strong> ?

      <h3>Policing and Protest</h3>

        People also use social media in an attempt to emancipate and build
        movements. The Arab Spring used social media to organise and evade
        disruptive forces.

        I'll be speaking to artists, venues and attendees to ask them what role
        they'd like to see each other play in appreciating the work. I'll be
        contacting:

        <li>Likewise with CCA</li>
        <li>
          Art attendees to find out what they'd like to get out of a performance
        </li>
        <li>
          Artists who perform on stage and in galleries to find out how they'd
          like their work to be viewed
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What would we like to know?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What are your best memories of attending exhibitions / festivals /
          gigs etc?
        </li>
        <li>What made that experience so memorable?</li>
        <li>What would you like to see from these events?</li>
