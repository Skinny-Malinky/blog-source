    <h3>An' A That</h3>
    <p>This project seeks to address the problem that many people have with Robert Burns’ poetry in that they only ever read
      it in school. By adding a playful element to the way that we interact with Burns’ poetry, we can explore it without
      having to worry about academic pressures.</p>
    <p>
      The action of tearing up the poetry allows us to cathartically explore the poem in a way that places no pressure on the individual
      to perform. If we decide we want to recreate the poem in new forms, the app will allow us to snap the words back into
      place in any order that we choose. We can also pick up the virtual pen and leave comments for our friends and family
      with the newly created Burns poem.</p>
