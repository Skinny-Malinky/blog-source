## Stressing out
Stress! That's my aim. I wanted to go further than last time. It's clear to me that time is an important element as the last sketch felt <a href="<%= config[:host] %>/blog/open-frameworks-and-processing#trippy-webcam" target="_blank">disconnected and loose</a>. This has much more of a satisfying, *disconcerting** feel to it. Whenever I use it I feel like I'm becoming more stressed just by appearing and moving in the image. It almost makes you want to stop moving. 

I suspect this won't be the end of my interest in alpha channels. I've been looking at an awful lot of <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/struanf/80s-90s-retro-design/" target="_blank"> old VHS covers on pinterest which may have something to do with it.</a>

It works by allowing the red alpha channel to move around in real time but only occasionally capturing the blue and green channels' frames. They also have a blend mode applied to them as appeared in the previous sketch.

Hopefully I'll be able to produce a p5js version some time soon so I can share it around but until then I'll settle for just listening to Carpenter Brut until my ears bleed â€“
