I had an interview with the BBC some years ago where I wanted to prove my grasp of human centred research using personas. Now that I know more, I'd like to school old me on the things I've learned while reflecting on how much further I have to go. Revisiting this task gives me a chance to reflect on the importance of personas at a time when they're coming under heavy criticism.

> Re-imagine the BBC Food experience on mobile.

The interview is scheduled for two weeks after the task is described. Time is limited: I want to make sure my ideas are informed and come across clearly. I discuss with some UX friends and sketch out a primitive research plan.

### Recruitment
The people who participated did not have the *range of abilities and experiences* that reflect the everyday users of BBC Food. This project requires spending some time finding users who display a range of behaviours with different abilities and backgrounds.

### Scenarios

I sketched out some assumptions and separated people into suspected use cases followed by some desk research around food apps, common cooking techniques, blogs and vlogs.

These sketches ended up closely resembling some persona hypotheses but they never quite made it that far.

### Notes

People appear to follow recipes completely differently. Many just look at the ingredients. Others follow the details meticulously. 

### When designing the thing

Important to easily pick out ingredients and instructions.
