It's the Christmas Holidays and I've been watching a lot of films as my veins ossify into a cheesy husk. I'll admit it's been pretty good.

In particular I've been watching a lot of Werner Herzog documentaries and a documentary series by the Guardian called Anywhere but Westminster by John Harris and John Domokos. I hadn't deliberately chosen these films because they had anything in common, but I found myself watching many honest first hand accounts of how people experience the world. Mostly, I was interested in the election that just passed and wanted to introduce some friends to Herzog's work.

I suspect it's got something to do with having just completed a research methods module but I can't help but feel like there's a lot to learn from these films.
