Playback is the core of the YouView experience and we aim to get people to playback programmes as quickly as possible. Playback should be as unobtrusive while offering clear affordances for trickplay options when they are available. 

We've looked at a number of options to improve playback including some novel ways to jump to different points in the playback bar. We've tried out these concepts using high fidelity prototypes with users.

During the testing of the playback bar, I helped introduce [Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE)](https://uxmag.com/articles/the-rite-way-to-prototype) which was not previously possible. Having a high fidelity prototyping framework meant we could respond to feedback much more quickly. We were able to quickly assess the time it takes to recognise and image has changed, association of visual affordances to functionality and a range of other things that we changed and tested.

We also tried out some other features such as quickly accessing more episodes in the series from the playback bar and directly mapping the duration of the programme to the buffer bar.
