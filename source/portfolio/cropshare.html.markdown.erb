Supermarkets and chain retailers dominate our high streets and many of us have a limited understanding of supply chains and the challenges that come with growing food. They squeeze out local suppliers and outlets.

The buttons on the CropShare totem broadcast to Twitter to connect growers on allotments, with people who want to supplement their food supply and ensure itâ€™s provenance. By enabling growers to advertise their surpluses on Twitter, we can create a better connection between consumers and producers, while helping people develop an understanding of seasonality and sustainable food sources.
